# Matching a URL (Regex Tutorial)

This is a tutorial describing the regular expression (regex) for matching a URL. The following sections will evaluate each component of the regex with informative descriptions about each step.

## Summary

This tutorial describes the regex, or sequence of characters that defines the specific search pattern of a URL, ```/^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/```. The characters used in this specific search pattern are called metacharacters, which instead of indicating a literal character, indicates a more generalized pattern. Regex are frequently used to validate input, as when included in code or search algorithms, regex can be used to find certain patterns of characters in a string, or find and replace a character or sequence of characters within a string.
